1. You will have to use something like urlib to download in python or equivalent in whichever language.
Likely pass your request through a list of rotating proxies to avoid triggering dos protection/or get whitelisted,
and possibly emulate a web browser if the site has bot protection. Other than that change the soup tags you look for.

2. beautifulsoup handles tree navigation, so find where the data you want is located on the html page and change a few tags.

3. So this question is a bit more challenging to answer. The reverse sorting algorithm in python like most languages has
an algorithmic complexity of nlog(n) for both best and worse case. First to fit is also nlog(n) so the order
hasn't changed only the coefficient. I could have implimented a more exact bin packing solution (fewest boxes), but not
without seriously increasing the resources needed. I could have also implimented a custom reverse sorting algorithm if
I knew the data was mostly ordered in a certain way. I could have added some validation that excluded the index for 10.0
lb boxes, but in this scope the extra complexity doesn't justify it.
